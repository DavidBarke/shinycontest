Transform tabular data and create plots with an interface you are used to from dplyr and ggplot2. A file explorer and a dynamic help system are as well introduced.

**Data** 
All datasets from the packages datasets, dplyr and ggplot2 are available per default. Custom datasets may be uploaded using the import interface. The import supports rds- and csv-files. Note that rds-files should be generated with an R version >= 3.5.0 .
